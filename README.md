# sre-challenge-05-over-collateralized-lending
This repo contains my implementation of SpeedRunEthereum Challenge 05 — Over-Collateralized Lending. This project showcases a decentralized lending protocol where users deposit ETH as collateral, borrow a synthetic stablecoin, track health factors, and support liquidation — built using Solidity, Hardhat, and Scaffold-ETH 2.
